# HipoUniversitiesTest

Tests that check the GET api for getting universities from http://universities.hipolabs.com/

I replaced reading file from resources on reading file from remote repo to always have fresh data

To run tests perfom command "mvn clean test" in project folder (to perform this command maven should be installed)
